import spindrift.network as network


'''
    standard 'hello world' for a network library

    to start the echo server run:

        python -m example.echo

    you can then connect to it with telnet on port
    12345 and see your input echoed back.

    Notes:

        1. the on_open method is called when a connection is made
           to the server

        2. the id attribute contains a unique id for connection
           to the server. each add_server call to Network
           generates id values independently. in other words,
           handler ids are only unique within a server.

        3. the on_close method is called when the connection is
           closed

        4. the on_data method is called with the data most recently
           received on the connection
