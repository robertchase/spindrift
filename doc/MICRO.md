# MICRO File
## A Reference Guide

A `micro` file describes the structure of a micro-service, leaving
the implementation of service logic to custom python functions.
Things like network, routing, database, logging are described in
a `micro` file, and managed by the *spindrift* framework.

## Structure of a `micro` file

A `micro` file is a set of single-line directives that each specify some aspect of a service.
A directive accepts parameters and sometimes creates a set of one or more `config` file records.

A directive starts with a directive-type token followed by some parameters. For example:

```
DATABASE user=foo database=bar
```

This record's directive-type is *DATABASE*, and the parameters *user* and *database* are specified.
The directive-type is case insensitive, although, upper case helps legibility.
The parameter names *are* case sensitive.

A directive may automatically create one or more config file records.
The *DATABASE* directive creates a number of config records. Here are a few:

```
db.user=foo
db.database=bar
```

The config file, if it exists, is read after parsing the `micro` file, and overrides any
previously specified defaults.
Treat the `micro` file as code, and use the config file for runtime configuration.

Boolean values, for instance *is_debug* can be any case-insensitive
version of *true* or *false*.

## Directives

### LOG

```
LOG name=MICRO level=debug is_stdout=true
```

The `log` directive overrides default logging behavior for *spindrift*.
By default, log messages are created with the *TAG* `MICRO`, log level
is set to `DEBUG` and messages are sent to stdout.
The value for `log.level` is case insensitive, and can be any
valid log level, typically, *debug* or *info*.

##### config

```
log.name=MICRO
log.level=DEBUG
log.is_stdout=true
```

### SERVER

```
SERVER name port
```

The `server` directive defines a port listening for incoming HTTP connections.
The `name` parameter is used in log messages and in the config.

##### config

```
server.[name].port=[port]
server.[name].is_active=true
server.[name].ssl.is_active=false
server.[name].ssl.keyfile=
server.[name].ssl.certfile=
```

A server is active by default, and operates without ssl. If `ssl.is_active=true`
is specified in the config, the `ssl.keyfile` and `ssl.certfile` must also
be specified, and must point to existing files.

### ROUTE

```
ROUTE [pattern]
```

The `route` directive defines a regular expression used to match
the *path* in incoming HTTP documents.

A `route` directive is not useful without subsequent
directives describing how to handle HTTP methods.

### GET / POST / PUT / DELETE

```
[GET|POST|PUT|DELETE] [path]
```

These directives define a code path to run when the respective HTTP method is received.

These directives will be associated with the most recently encountered `route` directive.

##### Example

```
ROUTE /users/(\d+)$
  GET myservice.handlers.user.get
  PUT myservice.handlers.user.update
```

Here, the function `get` in the program `myservice/handlers.user.py` will be called
when an HTTP document's method matches `GET` and the path matches `/users/123` (or any number).

The function `update` in the program `myservice/handlers.user.py` will be called
when an HTTP document's method matches `POST` and the path matches `/users/456` (or any number).

### DATABASE

```
DATABASE is_active=true user=None database=None host=None port=3306 isolation='READ COMMITTED', timeout=60.0 long_query=0.5 fsm_trace=False
```

The `database` directive defines a connection to a MySQL database.
Other databases *can* be supported, but are not at this time.

A service does not maintain a connection to the database instance; rather, request handlers can establish a connection
for the duration of a request to handle any database activity. Connections are short in duration and provided on demand.

##### parameters

`is_active` - turns connectivity on and off

`user` - database user

`database` - database name

`host` - database host

`port` - database port

`isolation` - session isolation level established at connection

`timeout` - maximum time, in seconds, that the connection can remain open

`long_query` - log warning message for queries exceeding specified seconds

`fsm_trace` - if true, log debug messages for driver state-event transitions


##### config

```
db.is_active=true
db.user=None
db.password=None
db.database=None
db.host=None env=MYSQL_HOST
db.port=3306
db.isolation=READ COMMITTED
db.timeout=60.0
db.long_query=.5
db.fsm_trace=false
```

### CONNECTION

### RESOURCE

### OPTIONAL
