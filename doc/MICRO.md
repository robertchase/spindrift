# MICRO File
## A Reference Guide

A `micro` file describes the structure of a micro-service, leaving
the implementation of service logic to custom python functions.
Things like network, routing, database, logging are described in
a `micro` file, and managed by the *spindrift* framework.

## Structure of a `micro` file

A `micro` file is a set of single-line directives that each specify some aspect of a service.
A directive accepts parameters and sometimes creates a set of one or more `config` file records.

A directive starts with a directive-type token followed by some parameters. For example:

```
DATABASE user=foo database=bar
```

This record's directive-type is *DATABASE*, and the parameters *user* and *database* are specified.
The directive-type is case insensitive, although, upper case helps legibility.
The parameter names, by contrast, are case sensitive.

A directive may automatically create one or more config file records.
The *DATABASE* directive creates a number of config records. Here are a few:

```
db.user=foo
db.database=bar
```

The config file, if it exists, is read after parsing the `micro` file, and overrides any
previously specified defaults.
Think of, and treat, the `micro` file as code. Think of the config file as runtime configuration.

Boolean values, for instance *is_debug* can be any case-insensitive
version of *true* or *false*.

## Directives

### LOG

```
LOG name=MICRO level=debug is_stdout=true
```

The `log` directive overrides default logging behavior for *spindrift*.
By default, log messages are created with the *TAG* `MICRO`, log level
is set to `DEBUG` and messages are sent to stdout.
The value for `log.level` is case insensitive, and can be any
valid log level, typically, *debug* or *info*.

##### config

```
log.name=MICRO
log.level=DEBUG
log.is_stdout=true
```

### SERVER

```
SERVER name port
```

The `server` directive defines a port listening for incoming HTTP connections.
The `name` parameter is used in log messages and in the config.

##### config

```
server.[name].port=[port]
server.[name].is_active=true
server.[name].ssl.is_active=false
server.[name].ssl.keyfile=
server.[name].ssl.certfile=
```

A server is active by default, and operates without ssl. If `ssl.is_active=true`
is specified in the config, the `ssl.keyfile` and `ssl.certfile` must also
be specified, and must point to existing files.

### ROUTE

```
ROUTE [pattern]
```

The `route` directive defines a regular expression used to match
the *path* in incoming HTTP documents.
